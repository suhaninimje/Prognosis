This has resulted in a 15% reduction in ICU admissions during outbreaks, and hospitals have been able to allocate critical resources more efficiently, ensuring that care is provided to those most in need. Furthermore, hospitals have reduced their overall operational costs, increasing patient care efficiency during high-demand periods.",
